The Terrors were forgotten; outlawed as “ancient delusion”. But then a day of reckoning came, when humans probed into the fabric of space too far and tore open the only material divide between them and their daemonic kin. It was then that the Terrors of Abaddon reached through the divide and catastrophically clarified that they were no mere “delusion”. And now these evil spirits- of-old easily tear their way through the material world, ceaselessly warring for physical dominion. They will not be forgotten again.');

It is uncertain as to whether the L’Orani of this universe are remnants of legitimate dwellers, or immigrants in galactic exile. Either way, they claim to be nobility: the only surviving prodigy of the original creator of existence.

Live or die, the U’rak have learned to do both spectacularly. While their origin is ancient, their evolution has been a path favoring “brawns” far above “brains”. Thus, the U’rak tend to prefer forcefully stealing wealth, dominion and technology instead of creating their own. Also, they are swarming in number, as their high rate of propagation (thankfully for them) barely outnumbers their desperately low life-expectancy. The young and puny U’rak grunts quickly learn that survival solely rests in serving their hulking and ruthless older brothers’ appetites for glitter and glory, staying loyal to their local, planetary tribe until they either die or grow big enough to inevitably rebel and lead a new planetary tribe of their own.');

While typically working alone, Hunters can be occasional-ly found prowling in small hunting parties, stalking their targets with unmatched skill and striking with lethal precision.

Regardless of their purpose, these gangs of space pirates are all an equally fierce and curious breed: outcasts, vagabonds and/or criminals exiled by their own kind and now loyal only to their ship and crew.
